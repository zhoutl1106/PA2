In PA2, we pick five production of William Shakespeareï¼Œ which are:
  THE SONNETS : pg1041.txt
  THE TRAGEDY OF JULIUS CAESAR : pg1120.txt
  A Midsommer Nights Dreame : pg2242.txt
  The Merchant of Venice : pg2243.txt
  The Tragedie of Hamlet : pg2265.txt

1. building stop word list
  In this part, we run a simple map-reduce of word count,
  mapper : mapper0.py
  reducer : reducer0.py
  a. we put the text files in /tmp/data, set output directory to /tmp/out0, running with cmd
    hadoop jar ${HADOOP_HOME}/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-2.7.1.jar -files mapper0.py,reducer0.py -mapper "mapper0.py" -reducer "reducer0.py" -input /tmp/data/* -output /tmp/out0
  b. After grabbing the result, we rename it to out0.txt, which is also provided.
  c. Then use script genStopWords.py which takes out0.txt as input and output stop words to stops.txt,
     for identify stop words, we pick 5 times the average frequency as threshold

    hadoop jar ${HADOOP_HOME}/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-2.7.1.jar -files mapper.py,reducer.py,stops.txt -mapper "mapper.py" -reducer "reducer.py" -input /tmp/data/* -output /tmp/out
